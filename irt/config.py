# classic item-discrimination classification, the most widely cited
# standard in classroom-test psychometrics (Ebel & Frisbie, "Essentials of
# Educational Measurement"). Ebel's D-index uses the SAME formula this
# module computes (upper-group accuracy - lower-group accuracy), just on a
# fixed 27%/27% split rather than a KMeans-derived one, which is exactly
# what makes it the right literature anchor here:

#   D < 0.00              -> negative (discriminates backwards; should be pulled/rewritten)
